        <h2> Who am I? </h2>
        <button class="accordion"> What am I studying? </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p> I am a Psychology and Neuroscience major with a Creative Technology and Design Minor at the University of Colorado, Boulder</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Where am I from?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>I grew up in Boulder, CO, in a family of Russian immigrants. Having grown up in a "non-traditional" American family, I have been able to explore my identity in my work, as well as the feelings of nostalgia, yearning, and loneliness I feel being a child of an immigrant family.</p>

        <button class="accordion"> What do I like to do?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Outside of school and work, I love to bike and spend time outside. I also think prioritizing time with friends and family is so important, so I love spending time outside with those I love the most!</p>

        <h2> My Research </h2>
        <button class="accordion">What research do I conduct?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>I currently am working at a Psychology and Neuroscience lab called the RADD Lab, at which we investigate relationships between mood disorders, stress, and neurobiology. While this is not entirely artistic, I have had the opportunities to work with our marketing manager and create various designs for our logo, as well as social media posts to spread our research and encourage young adults to learn more about psychology and neuroscience.</p>

        <h2>My Inspirations</h2>
        <button class="accordion"> What drives me to make art?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Ever since I was 3 years old, I have been creating. I took an art class with a teacher in the local area, and I fell in love with creating landscapes and stories with paint. Not only is it satisfying to lay paint over a canvas, but it gives purpose to the artwork: no matter its meaning, I made it caringly. Creating art has taught me patience, perseverence, self-love, and appreciation for the craft. I think as of recently, I've become really passionate about learning, particularly through using different mediums and going outside of my comfort zone. While it is scary, it drives me to create more, learn more, be a beginner and strive to make bigger and better art. That is what drives me to create.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion"> Who are my favorite artists?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Although I believe all art is valuable and important, especially when considering historical and social implications, I have to say my heart is very aligned with artists from the Impressionist and Realism eras. Particularly, I love the depth and creativity of Vincent Van Gogh, as well as the attention to detail and ability to capture the world of Ivan Shishkin. I am also fascinated by the artwork of Johannes Vermeer. His paintings always entrance me with the attention to light and creation of a certain aura.</p>
